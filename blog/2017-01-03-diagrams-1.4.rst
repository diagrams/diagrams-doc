============
Diagrams 1.4
============

The diagrams team is very pleased to announce the release of diagrams
1.4.  The release actually happened a few months ago, in October---we
just hadn't gotten around to writing about it yet.  But in any case
this was a fairly quiet release, with very few breaking changes;
mostly 1.4 just introduced new features.  There is a `migration
guide`_ which lists a few known potentially breaking changes, but most
users should have no trouble.  The rest of this post highlights some
of the new features in 1.4.

Alignment and layout
====================

Radial tree layout
------------------

The existing `Diagrams.TwoD.Layout.Tree`:mod: module from
`diagrams-contrib`:pkg: has XXX

Aligned composition
-------------------

Sometimes, it is desirable to compose some diagrams according to a
certain alignment, but without affecting their local origins. The
`composeAligned` function can be used for this purpose. It takes as
arguments an alignment function (such as `alignT` or `snugL`), a
composition function of type ``[Diagram] -> Diagram``, and produces a
new composition function which works by first aligning the diagrams
before composing them.

.. class:: dia-lhs

::

> example :: Diagram B
> example = (hsep 2 # composeAligned alignT) (map circle [5,1,3,2])
>         # showOrigin

Notice how the origin of the composed diagram is still at the center
of the leftmost circle, instead of at its top edge (where it would
normally be placed by `alignT`).

Constrained layout
------------------

The new `Diagrams.TwoD.Layout.Constrained`:mod: module from
`diagrams-contrib`:pkg: implements basic linear constraint-based
layout.  As a simple example of something that would be tedious to
draw without some kind of constraint solving, consider this diagram
which consists of a vertical stack of circles of different sizes,
along with an accompanying set of squares, such that (1) each square
is constrained to lie on the same horizontal line as a circle, and (2)
the squares all lie on a diagonal line.

.. class:: dia-lhs

::

> import Diagrams.TwoD.Layout.Constrained
> import Control.Monad (zipWithM_)
>
> example :: Diagram B
> example = frame 1 $ layout $ do
>   let rs = [2,2,4,3,5,6]
>   cirs <- newDias (map circle rs # fc blue)
>   sqs  <- newDias (replicate (length rs) (square 2) # fc orange)
>   constrainWith vcat cirs
>   zipWithM_ sameY cirs sqs
>   constrainWith hcat [cirs !! 0, sqs !! 0]
>   along (direction (1 ^& (-1))) (map centerOf sqs)
