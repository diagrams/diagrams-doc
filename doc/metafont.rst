Defining Trails and Paths with Metafont
=========================================

`Diagrams.TwoD.Path.Metafont`:mod: has tools to define Diagrams Trails
in the style of `Metafont`_.  This is a convenient way to draw smooth
curves through a series of points, with finer control available on
demand.  This tutorial does not assume prior experience with Metafont.
It does assume some famialiarity with `Diagrams Trails & Paths`_.

Getting started
===============

Let's start with the most boring possible example:

.. class:: dia-lhs

::
   
   > import Diagrams.TwoD.Path.Metafont
   > z1 = p2 (1,0)
   > example = metafont $ origin .--. endpt z1

I don't mean to suggest that you should actually draw such simple
paths this way.  Do take note of the new operator `.--.`, which
connects two points, and `endpt`, which is only needed at the rightmost
point.  We'll see a few more members of the family later on.

Metafont does all of it's interesting work on longer series of points.
Let's give it a whirl:

.. class:: lhs

::
   
   > z1 = p2 (0,1)
   > z2 = p2 (1,1)
   > z3 = p2 (2,1)
   > z4 = p2 (0,0)
   > z5 = p2 (1,0)
   > z6 = p2 (2,0)
   > example = metafont $ z4.--.z1.--.z2.--.endpt z6

.. class:: dia

::
   
   import Diagrams.TwoD.Path.Metafont

   --ptMark :: Diagram SVG R2
   ptMark = circle 0.02 # lw 0

   --illustrateSegment :: FixedSegment R2 -> Diagram SVG R2
   illustrateSegment (FLinear from to) = position [
     (from, ptMark # fc blue),
     (to,   ptMark # fc blue)]
   illustrateSegment (FCubic from c1 c2 to) = position [
     (c1, ptMark # fc red),
     (c2, ptMark # fc red)] <> illustrateSegment (FLinear from to)

   --illustrateTrail :: Renderable (Path R2) b => Trail R2 -> Diagram b R2
   illustrateTrail t = strokeTrail t <> (mconcat . map illustrateSegment . fixTrail . flip at origin $ t)

   z1 = p2 (0,1)
   z2 = p2 (1,1)
   z3 = p2 (2,1)
   z4 = p2 (0,0)
   z5 = p2 (1,0)
   z6 = p2 (2,0)
   example = illustrateTrail . metafont $ z4.--.z1.--.z2.--.endpt z6

With the code above, we've drawn a Path with three cubic Segments.
The endpoints of these segments, marked with blue dots, are the points
we specified.  The shape of each segment in the middle, described by
the red control points, was determined according to Metafont's
equations.  This is the simplest way to specify paths in Metafont;
Metafont does most of the work, and we do as little as possible.

I'll keep using the six points defined above in subsequent examples,
but will omit them (and the import statements) from the code samples.
I also haven't shown the code that adds the control point dots.  If
you want to use it for your own tests, see `Further Reading`_.

Specifying Directions
========================================

If you make a few curves like this, you'll soon find that the curve
Metafont makes isn't the one you had in mind.  There are a lot of
curves through those points, after all.  The real power of the
Metafont solver is that we can add more detailed specification to just
the segments where we want it.

For example, we can define the direction of the path at any point.
Here I ask for the trail to point to the right as it leaves z1.  The
adjacent paths will curve around to remain smooth and continuous.

.. class:: lhs

::

   example = metafont $ z4 .- leaving unitY -. z1.--.z2.--.endpt z6

.. class:: dia

::

   import Diagrams.TwoD.Path.Metafont

   --ptMark :: Diagram SVG R2
   ptMark = circle 0.02 # lw 0

   --illustrateSegment :: FixedSegment R2 -> Diagram SVG R2
   illustrateSegment (FLinear from to) = position [
     (from, ptMark # fc blue),
     (to,   ptMark # fc blue)]
   illustrateSegment (FCubic from c1 c2 to) = position [
     (c1, ptMark # fc red),
     (c2, ptMark # fc red)] <> illustrateSegment (FLinear from to)

   --illustrateTrail :: Renderable (Path R2) b => Trail R2 -> Diagram b R2
   illustrateTrail t = strokeTrail t <> (mconcat . map illustrateSegment . fixTrail . flip at origin $ t)

   z1 = p2 (0,1)
   z2 = p2 (1,1)
   z3 = p2 (2,1)
   z4 = p2 (0,0)
   z5 = p2 (1,0)
   z6 = p2 (2,0)
   example = illustrateTrail . metafont $ z4 .--. z1.- leaving unitX -.z2.--.endpt z6

The `(.--.)` operator is joined by two new operators, `(.-)` and
`(-.)`.  Between them, we write the description of the path connecting
these two points.  The complement of `leaving` is `arriving`, which
sets the direction of the path as it arrives at the point written to
the right.

Specifying Tensions
==============================

Metafont uses another parameter, called *tension*, in calculating
paths.  As the tension increases, a segment between two points will
become closer to the straight-line path between those points.  As the
name suggests, you can picture the path as an elastic band, being
pulled taut.  The tension defaults to 1; here we set it to 1.5.

.. class:: lhs

::

   example = metafont $ z4 .--. z1.- tension 1.5 -.z2.--.endpt z6

.. class:: dia

::

   import Diagrams.TwoD.Path.Metafont

   --ptMark :: Diagram SVG R2
   ptMark = circle 0.02 # lw 0

   --illustrateSegment :: FixedSegment R2 -> Diagram SVG R2
   illustrateSegment (FLinear from to) = position [
     (from, ptMark # fc blue),
     (to,   ptMark # fc blue)]
   illustrateSegment (FCubic from c1 c2 to) = position [
     (c1, ptMark # fc red),
     (c2, ptMark # fc red)] <> illustrateSegment (FLinear from to)

   --illustrateTrail :: Renderable (Path R2) b => Trail R2 -> Diagram b R2
   illustrateTrail t = strokeTrail t <> (mconcat . map illustrateSegment . fixTrail . flip at origin $ t)

   z1 = p2 (0,1)
   z2 = p2 (1,1)
   z3 = p2 (2,1)
   z4 = p2 (0,0)
   z5 = p2 (1,0)
   z6 = p2 (2,0)

   example = illustrateTrail . metafont $ z4 .--. z1.- tension 1.5 -.z2.--.endpt z6

Higher tension corresponds to bezier control points closer to the
adjacent endpoint.  As a result, the segment has most of its curvature
close to the endpoints, and is relatively straight through the middle.

As that description suggests, a segment actually has two tensions, one
at each end.  The `tension` function sets them to the same value.  The
`tensions` function takes two arguments, to set them independently.

Putting it All Together
==============================

If you want to specify tensions and a direction, or both directions
for a given segment, joins can be combined using `<>`.  For example:

.. class:: lhs

::

   example = metafont $ z4 .--. z1.- tension 1.5 <> arriving unitX -.z2.--.endpt z6

Explicit Control Points
==============================

If you need complete control over a particular segment, you can
specify the control points directly using the function `controls`.
This function takes two `P2` values, and goes between `.-` and `-.`,
just like `leaving` or `tension`.

String Parsing
================

If you want to use paths already written for Metafont / Metapost, or
want to stay even closer to that syntax, there is a parser available
which implements the Metafont path syntax directly.  At the expense of
compile-time validity checking, and Haskell variables for points and
directions, you can use the terser syntax created for
Metafont.

.. class:: dia-lhs

::

   > {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
   > import qualified Diagrams.TwoD.Path.Metafont as MF
   > import Control.Lens as L
   > example = L.view _Right $ MF.fromString "(1,0)..(0,0)..(0,1)..tension 1.2..(2,1)..(2,0)..cycle"

Quasiquoting
============================

.. container:: todo

   Add dequoting to the parser, so we can interpolate Haskell variables into Metafont syntax.

Further Reading
========================================
Here is the code that marks the control points in examples above:

.. class:: lhs

::

   -- Type signatures may be needed to resolve ambiguity
   --ptMark :: Diagram SVG R2
   ptMark = circle 0.02 # lw 0

   --illustrateSegment :: FixedSegment R2 -> Diagram SVG R2
   illustrateSegment (FLinear from to) = position [
     (from, ptMark # fc blue),
     (to,   ptMark # fc blue)]
   illustrateSegment (FCubic from c1 c2 to) = position [
     (c1, ptMark # fc red),
     (c2, ptMark # fc red)] <> illustrateSegment (FLinear from to)

   --illustrateTrail :: Renderable (Path R2) b => Trail R2 -> Diagram b R2
   illustrateTrail t = strokeTrail t <> (mconcat . map illustrateSegment . fixTrail . flip at origin $ t)
