How to write diagrams tutorials
===============================

Know how to explain a certain technique?  Have a cool diagram which
makes for a good, illustrative example but is too long to go in the
gallery?  Write a tutorial!

Getting started
===============

Tutorials on the diagrams website (and the user manual) are written
using the `reStructuredText format`_.  Though it is a large and
complex format, there's not a lot you need to know in order to write a
tutorial.

.. _`reStructuredText format`: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html

The most important advice is to take a look at the source for the user
manual and other tutorials for examples, and copy and paste one to get
started (for example, there is some routine boilerplate that must go
at the top).  Tutorials go in the `diagrams-doc`:repo: repository, in the
``doc`` subdirectory.  For example, the user manual is ``doc/manual.rst``;
the source for this tutorial is ``doc/tutorials.rst``.  Just copy one
of those into ``doc/your-tutorial-name.rst``, and off you go!

Basic formatting
================

In addition to the below notes, you can refer to the `quick
reference`_ for more details.

* *Italics* can be produced with ``*asterisks*``.
* Make bulleted lists by precededing the items with ``*``.
* Everything can be nested; you simply have to be careful with
  indentation (as in Haskell, indentation is used to determine the
  extent of each scope).
* The format for hyperlinks is a bit strange; see the user manual for
  examples, or refer to the `quick reference`_.
* Headings levels are indicated by underlining heading titles, with a
  different character for each level.  From top (biggest) to bottom
  (smallest), the heading characters are ``=``, ``-``, ``~``, and
  ``+``.

.. _`quick reference`: http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html

Diagrams-specific formatting
============================

The diagrams documentation toolchain is set up to recognize and handle
some special markup.  Inline markup is accomplished by surrounding
some text in backquotes, followed by a tag surrounded by colons, like
```some text here`:tag:``.

* Haskell expressions should be enclosed in single backquotes.  Such
  expressions will be linked to Haddock documentation as appropriate.
  For example, ```circle 1``` is typeset like this: `circle 1`.
* For other literal expressions which should be typeset using a
  monospaced font, use double backquotes, like ````foo````.
* For embedded `\LaTeX`:math: like `2 + \sqrt{\pi}`:math:, use the
  ``math`` tag, as in ```2 + \sqrt{\pi}`:math:``.  Math is typeset
  using `MathJax`_.
* For names of packages on Hackage, use the ``pkg`` tag, as in
  ```diagrams-lib`:pkg:``.  Package names tagged with ``pkg`` will
  automatically turn into Hackage links, like this: `diagrams-lib`:pkg:.
* For names of diagrams-related modules, use the ``mod`` tag, as in
  ```Diagrams.Path`:mod:``.  This will turn into a link to the
  Haddock documentation *hosted on the diagrams website* (not
  Hackage), like this: `Diagrams.Path`:mod:. Hence, this should only
  be used for modules which are hosted on the diagrams website.

Code blocks
===========

Literal blocks are indicated by a double colon on a line by itself,
followed by a blank line, followed by an indented block, optionally
using bird tracks (blocks using bird tracks do not have to be
indented).  Such blocks will be typeset using a monospaced font.

To assign a "class" to a literal block, prefix the double colon by an
additional blank line and the syntax ``.. class:: foo``.  For example,
a literal block with the class ``lhs`` could be specified as follows:

::

  .. class:: lhs

  ::

  > x = 13
  > z = square 2 <> circle 3

which produces:

.. class:: lhs

::

> x = 13
> z = square 2 <> circle 3

As you can see, the ``lhs`` class produces syntax-highlighted and
hyperlinked literate Haskell source.  To include an inline diagram,
use the ``dia`` class and define a diagram named ``example``.  For
example,

::

  .. class:: dia

  ::

  > myCircle = circle 1 # fc purple
  > example = hcat (replicate 4 myCircle)

produces

.. class:: dia

::

> myCircle = circle 1 # fc purple
> example = hcat (replicate 4 myCircle)

Finally, using ``dia-lhs`` will produce a diagram *and* typeset the
code below it.  For example, changing ``dia`` to ``dia-lhs`` above
produces

.. class:: dia-lhs

::

> myCircle = circle 1 # fc purple
> example = hcat (replicate 4 myCircle)

Static images
=============

.. image:: /doc/static/phone.png
   :width: 300
   :align: center

If you have some static images (that is, images which are not
generated by diagrams code, but are to be stored explicitly in the
`diagrams-doc`:repo: repository), you can put them in the
``doc/static`` directory, and reference them in several ways.  To
include a static image in a tutorial, as above, do something like

::

  .. image:: /doc/static/phone.png
     :width: 300
     :align: center

(this is the code used for the image above); note the leading slash.
To reference an image from a diagram, do something like

::

  .. class:: dia

  ::

  > no = (circle 1 <> hrule 2 # rotateBy (1/8))
  >    # lw 0.2 # lc red
  > example = no <> image "doc/static/phone.png" 1.5 1.5

(note the *lack* of a leading slash), which produces

.. class:: dia

::

> no = (circle 1 <> hrule 2 # rotateBy (1/8))
>    # lw 0.2 # lc red
> example = no <> image "doc/static/phone.png" 1.5 1.5

Building
========

It's ideal to continuously rebuild the diagrams website locally while
you're writing, so you can see what the final product looks like.  The
website takes a bit of effort to build initially, but once you have it
built, incremental rebuilds are very fast (thanks to `shake`:pkg: and
`hakyll`:pkg:), making for a tight edit-compile-view feedback loop.
For instructions on how to build the diagrams website, see the
`diagrams-doc README`__.
