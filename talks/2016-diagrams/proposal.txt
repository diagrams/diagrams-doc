Main organizer bio
------------------

Brent Yorgey (http://ozark.hendrix.edu/~yorgey/) is an assistant
professor of computer science at Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas,
and a well-known developer and educator in the open-source functional
programming community.  He has served on the Haskell core libraries
committe, on the program committee of the ACM SIGPLAN Haskell
Symposium, and currently serves on the steering committee for the
Workshop on Functional Art, Music, Modeling, and Design (FARM).  His
educational materials are widely recommended and used by beginners
learning the Haskell programming language.  He has led development of
the Haskell diagrams framework since its inception in 2008.

Description
-----------

The tutorial will be a hands-on introduction to the Haskell diagrams
framework and, incidentally, to the Haskell programming language
itself.  No previous experience with Haskell or with functional
programming will be assumed.  As an embedded domain-specific language,
the framework can be used in basic, productive ways without knowing
much Haskell; learning Haskell enables more sophisticated uses.  The
format will consist of presentations of concepts and examples
interspersed with hands-on exercises for participants.  All necessary
software is free and open-source, and detailed installation
instructions will be provided.

The tutorial should be of interest to a wide cross-section of Diagrams
attendees. The Haskell diagrams framework is a powerful, open-ended,
open-source exploratory tool that can be used for a variety of
purposes, and may be directly applicable in many contexts that
participants care about, both in academic and practical settings,
enabling them to explore or produce diagrams in more effective ways.


Abstract
--------

The Haskell diagrams framework (http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams)
is an open-source, domain-specific language for creating vector
graphics, embedded in the Haskell programming language
(http://haskell.org).

The work of dozens of contributors, it serves as a powerful platform
for creating illustrations, visualizations, and artwork, as well as a
testbed for new ideas in functional domain-specific languages and in
functional approaches to graphics.  The language is declarative, that
is, one writes a program describing what the desired result is rather
than explicitly describing the steps needed to draw it.  It allows one
to work at a high level and to build further abstractions for
concisely expressing arbitrary classes of diagrams.  The framework can
thus be used for rapid prototyping and development of visualizations,
and can easily serve as a base upon which to develop more specialized
diagram generation software.

The tutorial will be a hands-on introduction to the Haskell diagrams
framework and, incidentally, to the Haskell programming language
itself.  No previous experience with Haskell or with functional
programming will be assumed.  As an embedded domain-specific language,
the framework can be used in basic, productive ways without knowing
much Haskell; learning Haskell enables more sophisticated uses.  The
format will consist of presentations of concepts and examples
interspersed with hands-on exercises for participants.  All necessary
software is free and open-source, and detailed installation
instructions will also be provided.

Length: the tutorial will run for three hours.

Learning Objectives
===================

At the end of the tutorial, participants will be familiar with the
rudiments of the Haskell programming language, and will be able to use
the Haskell diagrams framework to create their own moderately
sophisticated vector graphics.  In addition, participants will
be pointed in the direction of next steps to deepen their knowledge,
for example, if they wish to develop their own specialized frameworks
using the given one as a basis.

Prerequisites
=============

No background in Haskell or functional programming will
be assumed.  Some experience programming in other languages may be
helpful, but is not required.  Participants should bring their own
laptop for use in completing the exercises.  Instructions on
installing the required software will be available from
http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams before the conference.
