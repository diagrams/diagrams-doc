    - running: https://travis-ci.org/diagrams/monoid-extras/builds/592632072
    - failed on GHC 8.8 and 7.8.  8.8 probably due to cabal-3.0 stuff,
      which should be fixed now with a recent diagrams-travis PR.
      Rerunning it to see.
    - Removed support for GHC 7.8; criterion wasn't building.
